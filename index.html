                        <p>This web app was inspired by <a href="https://theworld.com/~reinhold/passgen.html">the old Java applet version created by Arnold Reinhold</a>, the latest version of which was released in 2003. Because browsers no longer support Java applets, a JavaScript-based web app was created instead. This page is not (yet) mobile-friendly.</p>
                        <p>To use this generator, just click anywhere in the text area above to ensure it's focused and start typing. At first, dots will be displayed in the text window. After you have typed 40 characters characters, your password will start to appear. Continue typing to complete the password. Keep typing to generate more passwords.</p>
                        <p>You can type in anything you like or just close your eyes and type characters at random. For extra credit, type in the serial numbers from a couple of dollar bills or other paper currency. The web app records the time in milliseconds when you press down and release each key and uses these time values, along with the key characters you type, as a source of randomness. There will normally be enough variability in your typing times to ensure that the characters that appear in the text window are highly random.</p>

                        <p>This web app is not the most secure way to make your password! Traces of the passwords you create can be left behind in your computer's memory, among other risks. Clicking "Save Entropy" will store the current RNG state to your local disk. Spritz is backtracking resistant, so an adversary should not be able to regenerate prior passwords from it, and they should not be able to predict your keystrokes, so future passwords should be improbable to generate also. But a leaked RNG state could present other risks. For maximum security we still recommend using ordinary dice to select a password or passphrase. See the <a href="http://world.std.com/~reinhold/diceware.html">Diceware page</a> for more details.</p>
                        <p>PassGen3 awards only 2 bits of entropy per character typed. This is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_(information_theory)">Shannon entropy of English text</a> and <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33571075/">synchronization between keyboard typing and neural oscillations</a>. There may be more entropy per keystroke, but 2 bits is about a liberal as I dare award and it's enough to generate passwords very quickly. As such, you will be required to type 40 characters on page load to seed the state with at least 80 bits of entropy before passwords begin to appear. PassGen3 does track all entropy accumulated and used to make your typing as efficient as possible.</p>
                        <p>The security margins of each password type are as follows:</p>
                        <div class="panel-body">
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Diceware</strong>: 13 bits per word</li>
                                <li><strong>ASCII</strong>: ~6.55 bits per character</li>
                                <li><strong>Pseudowords</strong>: 16 bits per wor</li>
                                <li><strong>Alphanumeric</strong>: ~5.95 bits per character</li>
                                <li><strong>Alphabetic</strong>: ~4.70 bits per character</li>
                                <li><strong>Hexadecimal</strong>: 4 bits per character</li>
                                <li><strong>Decimal</strong>: ~3.32 bits per character</li>
                                <li><strong>Senary</strong>: ~2.58 bits per character</li>

                        <p>Nonetheless, using this web app to generate a password is far safer than picking your pet's name or your mother's birthday. Because JavaScript web apps download from an untrusted web server, there is risk of mischief. This web app does not make any network connections, so you can run it off-line after you download it and inspect the source code.</p>
                        <p>You should be aware that someone could substitute a bogus version of the web app that creates apparently random passwords that are, in fact, easy for the adversary to guess. To reduce this risk, <a href="https://github.com/atoponce/passgen3">the source code of the web app is published as open source</a>.</p>
                        <p>Random generation methods will very rarely create a password that is an English word or phrase or simple letter pattern. If a password looks like an ordinary word (or, with the "ASCII" template, is all the same case) simply type some more and use the next password.</p>

                    <div class="row"> <!-- Technical Details -->
                        <p>PassGen3 uses a strong method for mixing randomness. The first version of PassGen used an entropy distiller with a 64-bit internal state, based on a linear congruential algorithm. PassGen2 used an entropy distiller based on the weak RC4 cipher. PassGen3 uses an entropy distiller based on the Spritz cipher.</p>
                        <p>As in Spritz, PassGen3 uses a 256-byte state vector that is initialized to be a null permutation. As Spritz is based on a sponge construction, both the keypress time in milliseconds and the character value are absorbed to permute the Spritz state. As such, the Spritz state is highly mixed by each keystroke. Each password output character is then squeezed out of the Spritz state.</p>
                        <p>When using an 8-bit value to select a character from an alphabet of length "n", there is a risk of bias if "n" does not evenly divide 256. To eliminate this, candidate cipher output bytes are discarded if they are outside of the range that is the largest multiple of "n" less than or equal to 256.</p>
                        <p><a href="https://semanticscholar.org/paper/18b763d71b21558232bca8335338400159d8e492">Published analysis</a> have shown that Spritz can be distinguished from true random white noise. But this is not of consequence to compromise the generation of a few passwords. PassGen3 performs extensive absorbing of initialization data when the page is loaded to eliminate any early and potential RC4-like biases, as Spritz is similar in design to RC4. PassGen3 adds a feature of generating and absorbing a basic 128-bit browser fingerprint with SipHash when the page is first loaded.</p>
                        <p>Using Spritz has several advantages. The capacity of Spritz as a sponge construction is large, at 936 bits, larger than SHA-3. The design as a sponge construction makes it ideal for other uses, such as cryptographic hash functions, deterministic random bit generators, an authenticated encryption cipher with associated data, etc. Like RC4, it is simple to implement and easy to verify. The last consideration is important for anyone contemplating using a utility downloaded over the Internet. Unfortunately, Spritz is significantly less efficient than RC4 and is about 50% the performance in hardware when compared to Keccak, another sponge algorithm. Performance isn't a concern for this web app however. People desiring even greater assurance in security can use the dice-based password generation techniques described at <a href="https://www.diceware.com">https://www.diceware.com</a>.
